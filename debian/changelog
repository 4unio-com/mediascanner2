  * debian/*symbols: auto-update new symbols to released version

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Increase the timeout on D-Bus method calls. (LP: #1326753)
  * Catch exceptions in the QML plugin, and print a warning instead. QML
    applications terminate when C++ exceptions bubble up, which can not
    be recovered from. (LP: #1326753)
  * Add support for scanning photos using libexif. Adds libexif-dev as
    new build dependency. (LP: #1256334)

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Get rid of the direct constructor for MediaFile, forcing creation to 
    go through MediaFileBuilder (which won't break when we add more 
    metadata fields).
    Also move MediaFile fields to a private struct to avoid breaking ABI 
    in future when adding new metadata fields.
  * Add a D-Bus service exposing the MediaStore, and move the QML binding 
    over to using it.
  * Limit access to the MediaScanner D-Bus interface from confined
    processes.
    The trust-store API does not exist yet, so it just hard codes support 
    for the "com.ubuntu.music" application.
  * Introduce a mediascanner::Filter type to hold search parameters for
    the various MediaStore::list*() methods, and expand them to handle
    genres. The new API also distinguishes between an unset filter and
    a filter set to "". Make similar changes to the QML API, and add
    notify signals to the rowCount properties.
    (LP: #1319168, LP: #1319174).

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Add support for .nomedia files to prevent chosen subtrees from being 
    scanned. (LP: #1294303).
  * Fix a few warnings emitted by clang.
  * Guard against empty MediaFileBuilders.
  * Fix CMake Project name.
  * Prune those files that have a scan block file on their path when 
    restoring.

  * Add genre and discNumber metadata fields to the media index, and
    expose it in the QML binding. Add rowCount property and get(row,
    role) method to each of the model classes in the QML binding. (LP:
    #1246172)

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Don't scan optical discs.
  * Use generator for file traversal instead of a vector.

  * Remove the Unity scope found in src/utils: it looks like it has
    suffered from bit rot and has never been used (we have unity-scope-
    mediascanner instead). This also removes an unnecessary dependency
    on the old libunity.
  * Before using GStreamer to extract metadata from a file, print a log
    message. This is intended to help track problems with metadata
    extraction.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Avoid assert crash by not trying to unregister subvolumes that were
    skipped due to looking like root subdirs. (LP: #1294193)
  * The output value of stat is undefined when the stat call fails. So
    don't use it.

  * Expose an "art" role/property on album and song models, returning a
    URI that can be used with a QML Image component. The actual image
    provider comes from ubuntu-ui-toolkit.

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * First stages of a QML plugin for the Media Scanner. At present it 
    only exposes the query() and lookup() interfaces.
  * Relax the rules for tokenising the input when it ends with a short 
    token followed '*' wildcard. This allows us to produce results for 
    short strings when doing incremental searches.
  * Convert the scanner daemon over to using the glib main loop rather 
    than a hand rolled one, and limit invalidation signals to be sent at 
    most once a second.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Add sqlite error string to exception.
  * Shutdown cleanly on signals.
  * Made SQLite db safe to access from multiple threads.

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Fix incorrect depends

  * Add a limit argument to MediaStore::queryAlbums(), and ensure that
    it returns some results when given an empty query string.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Added const qualifiers to methods and made album immutable just like
    mediafile.
  * Use lstat to avoid loops.
  * Fix path where media cache is stored.
  * Nil merge to get on the release train.
  * Send invalidation signal once the db is fully populated.

  * Fix a few issues that prevent the scanner daemon from running when
    stdin is redirected to /dev/null.
  * Fix the licensing on the public library so that it is correctly
    labelled as LGPL, like the old mediascanner code base.

  * debian/usr.bin.mediascanner-service-2.0: couple more minor updates for
    (mostly) noisy denials
    - use consoles abstraction instead of just the pts interface since we need
      /dev/tty when crashing
    - finetune orcexec rules by allowing 'm' in /tmp but explicitly deny the
      others
    - allow non-owner read of @{PROC}/cmdline
    - use attach_disconnected for /dev/socket/property_service

  * Enable the QML plugin to pick between two MediaStore backends: the
    direct disk backend and the D-Bus interface. The choice is made via
    the MEDIASCANNER_USE_DBUS environment variable, and defaults to
    direct access.

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Increase the timeout on D-Bus method calls. (LP: #1326753)
  * Catch exceptions in the QML plugin, and print a warning instead. QML
    applications terminate when C++ exceptions bubble up, which can not
    be recovered from. (LP: #1326753)
  * Add support for scanning photos using libexif. Adds libexif-dev as
    new build dependency. (LP: #1256334)

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Get rid of the direct constructor for MediaFile, forcing creation to 
    go through MediaFileBuilder (which won't break when we add more 
    metadata fields).
    Also move MediaFile fields to a private struct to avoid breaking ABI 
    in future when adding new metadata fields.
  * Add a D-Bus service exposing the MediaStore, and move the QML binding 
    over to using it.
  * Limit access to the MediaScanner D-Bus interface from confined
    processes.
    The trust-store API does not exist yet, so it just hard codes support 
    for the "com.ubuntu.music" application.
  * Introduce a mediascanner::Filter type to hold search parameters for
    the various MediaStore::list*() methods, and expand them to handle
    genres. The new API also distinguishes between an unset filter and
    a filter set to "". Make similar changes to the QML API, and add
    notify signals to the rowCount properties.
    (LP: #1319168, LP: #1319174).

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Add support for .nomedia files to prevent chosen subtrees from being 
    scanned. (LP: #1294303).
  * Fix a few warnings emitted by clang.
  * Guard against empty MediaFileBuilders.
  * Fix CMake Project name.
  * Prune those files that have a scan block file on their path when 
    restoring.

  * Remove the Unity scope found in src/utils: it looks like it has
    suffered from bit rot and has never been used (we have unity-scope-
    mediascanner instead). This also removes an unnecessary dependency
    on the old libunity.
  * Before using GStreamer to extract metadata from a file, print a log
    message. This is intended to help track problems with metadata
    extraction.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Avoid assert crash by not trying to unregister subvolumes that were
    skipped due to looking like root subdirs. (LP: #1294193)
  * The output value of stat is undefined when the stat call fails. So
    don't use it.

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * First stages of a QML plugin for the Media Scanner. At present it 
    only exposes the query() and lookup() interfaces.
  * Relax the rules for tokenising the input when it ends with a short 
    token followed '*' wildcard. This allows us to produce results for 
    short strings when doing incremental searches.
  * Convert the scanner daemon over to using the glib main loop rather 
    than a hand rolled one, and limit invalidation signals to be sent at 
    most once a second.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Add sqlite error string to exception.
  * Shutdown cleanly on signals.
  * Made SQLite db safe to access from multiple threads.

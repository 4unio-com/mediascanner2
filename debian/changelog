mediascanner2 (0.100+14.04.20140307.1-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * First stages of a QML plugin for the Media Scanner. At present it 
    only exposes the query() and lookup() interfaces.
  * Relax the rules for tokenising the input when it ends with a short 
    token followed '*' wildcard. This allows us to produce results for 
    short strings when doing incremental searches.
  * Convert the scanner daemon over to using the glib main loop rather 
    than a hand rolled one, and limit invalidation signals to be sent at 
    most once a second.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Add sqlite error string to exception.
  * Shutdown cleanly on signals.
  * Made SQLite db safe to access from multiple threads.

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Fix incorrect depends

  * Fix path where media cache is stored.
  * Nil merge to get on the release train.
  * Send invalidation signal once the db is fully populated.
